## Treinkaart

This is the visual map single page app

To run locally: `yarn dev` to start python server then in a different window `yarn watch` to watch for changes in `script.ts`

To publish, run `yarn build` and that moves all necessary files to the `build/` dir. 

This is hosted on Github pages so just push to `main` branch
